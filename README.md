# One-Day Tour Planning Assistant

## Overview
The **One-Day Tour Planning Assistant** is a conversational, AI-driven tool that helps users design a personalized itinerary for a one-day trip in any city. This assistant leverages **Ollama** to create an interactive and adaptive experience, allowing users to outline preferences, adjust details, and receive a customized, optimized itinerary in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Chat-Based Interface**: Users specify preferences like city, budget, interests, and schedule through a user-friendly chat interface. 
- **Personalized Memory Persistence**: By storing user preferences across sessions, the assistant personalizes future itineraries based on historical data, providing a progressively more tailored experience.
- **Real-Time Itinerary Adjustment**: The assistant dynamically adapts the plan as users add new constraints, ensuring flexibility and convenience throughout the planning process.
- **Optimized Travel Routes**: Itineraries are crafted to balance user preferences, time, and budget. For example, taxi options are recommended when feasible within the budget.
- **Contextual Weather and Attraction Status Integration**: The assistant factors in current weather and attraction statuses to help users avoid potential disruptions.
- **Visual Itinerary & Map**: A comprehensive itinerary includes a visual map, optimized travel routes, time allocations, and estimated costs.
